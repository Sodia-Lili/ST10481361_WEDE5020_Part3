 Part 3 README

Overview
A website is being made for the small business SaniSide. They have experienced a growth in their team, so I was tasked to create a website where they can showcase their product and branch out to newer customers. This file is currently going through the stylisation of the website according to the customer's aesthetic and my creative freedom, as well as discretion.
