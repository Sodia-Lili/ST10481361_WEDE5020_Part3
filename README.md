 Part 3 README

Overview
A website is being made for the small business SaniSide. They have experienced growth in their team, so I was tasked with creating a website where they can showcase their product and reach new customers. This file contains the updated version of the website, featuring added JavaScript functions and SEO tags. The JavaScript functions added:
* Search Bar: Can search for available products
* Arrows: To enable scrolling of products
* LightBox: Enlarges the product image with details
* Map: Added a map to find the store
* Form Validation: Added functionality to the contact form and subscribe form
* SEO: Added for better searchability. Title tags and meta descriptions so crawlers can find and provide better recommendations.
